# nmapAutomator

A script that you can run in the background!
  
  
## Summary

The main goal for this script is to automate all of the process of recon/enumeration that is run every time, and instead focus our attention on real pen testing.  
  
This will ensure two things:  
	1) Automate nmap scans. 
	2) Always have some recon running in the background. 

Once initial ports are found '*in around 10 seconds*', we can start manually looking into those ports, and let the rest run in the background with no interaction from our side whatsoever.  
  
  
## Features:
1. **Quick:**	Shows all open ports quickly (~15 seconds)  
1. **Basic:**	Runs Quick Scan, then runs a more thorough scan on found ports (~5 minutes)  
1. **UDP:**	  Runs "Basic" on UDP ports (~5 minutes)  
1. **Full:** 	Runs a full range port scan, then runs a thorough scan on new ports (~5-10 minutes)  
1. **Vulns:**	Runs CVE scan and nmap Vulns scan on all found ports (~5-15 minutes)  
1. **Recon:**	Runs "Basic" scan "if not yet run", then suggests recon commands "i.e. gobuster, nikto, smbmap" based on the found ports, then prompts to automatically run them  
1. **All:**  	Runs all the scans consecutively (~20-30 minutes)
